### Rule-Based System Troubleshooting & Documentation

**Category:** Technical Project / IT Problem-Solving  
**Tools:** TradingView, Alpaca, spreadsheets, GitHub  

**Problem:**  
During testing of a rule-based system, behavior was inconsistent with expected outcomes.

**Troubleshooting Process (CompTIA A+ Aligned):**  
- Identified the problem by comparing expected results to actual outcomes  
- Established a theory of probable cause by reviewing rule logic and data timing  
- Tested the theory by modifying one variable at a time across **10+ rule variations**  
- Verified full system functionality by monitoring performance after each change  
- Documented findings, actions taken, and results for future reference  

**Actions Taken:**  
- Manually tracked **win rate percentages**, failure frequency, and behavior notes on paper  
- Documented expected vs. actual behavior for each variation  
- Isolated variables and adjusted logic incrementally to confirm root causes  
- Maintained written change notes to support repeatable testing and refinement  

**Outcome:**  
Improved system consistency by reducing logic conflicts and enforcing a structured testing and documentation process.

**IT Skills Applied:**  
CompTIA A+ troubleshooting methodology, documentation, change tracking, root cause analysis

**Evidence:**  
Handwritten test logs with percentage results and evaluation notes, summarized digitally

**Timeframe:**  
Ongoing (iterative testing and evaluation)
